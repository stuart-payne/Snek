# Snek

This is a implementation of the classic game Snake in Unity. [Play the game here!](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/snek-6xio)

# How to use these files

If you want to open this project on your own machine, download these files either using git clone or download the zip of the repo using the Code button on this page.

You will then need to download [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (if you don't already have it).

Open Unity Hub and press the Add button in the Projects tab and chose the folder you either cloned the repo to or unzipped the zip file to. Unity Hub will then download the the correct editor version and after that, you should be able to use the project.
